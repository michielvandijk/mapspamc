\title{Prepares grid cell priors and scores for all crops and production system combinations}
\usage{
prepare_priors_and_scores2(param)
}
\arguments{
\item{param}{Object of type \code{mapspamc_par} that bundles all \code{mapspamc} parameters,
including core model folders, alpha-3 country code, year, spatial
resolution, most detailed level at which subnational statistics are
available, administrative unit level at which the model is solved and type of
model.}
}
\description{
Creates the priors and the scores for each grid cell. For convenience, the
function will always create data tables with priors and scores even though
only one might required.
}
\details{
Note that the function might take some time to run as it implements three
consecutive processes. First, the biophysical suitability and potential yield
maps for all production system and crop combinations are loaded and only grid
cells that overlap with the cropland extent from the previous step are
selected, after which all data is merged into one table and saved. This
process also checks if the maps do not only contain zero values and, where
needed, replaces the map by a substitute crop. This is important because it
occasionally happens that the biophysical suitability and potential yield
maps indicate zero suitability for a specific crop although the statistics
suggest the crop is produced in the country. Not correction for this, would
result in an ‘uninformed’ allocation of the crop, meaning it can be placed
anywhere as long as the the constraints are satisfied and the objective
function (minimization of cross-entropy or maximization of fitness score) is
optimized. In case all the substitute crops have zero values, a warning is
issued. The list of substitute crop is stored in the mappings/replace_gaez.sv
file and can be adjusted by the user. The second and third process create
data files with the priors and scores using the biophysical suitability and
potential yield, among others, as input data.
